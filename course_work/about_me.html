            <p> As u can see in the header my name is saed I'm 19 yo in the 9th of next august I'll be 20, 
                and I'm a software engineering student at Alyamamah universty. 
                I like to watch tv-shows and anime in my free time, I don't play a lot of games but I'd like to sometime,
                 also I'm a soccer fan. however, I can say till now I didn't have much or do much in my life
                but I'm really looking forward to a great future where I get to make a huge name to my self in the 
                software community and in other fields as well. Tbh, I chose to study software just for my career
                I mean I didn't like it before, but now I'd like to know how to code a websites, apps, games, kinda every other thing 
                then I'll know what I like to code the most and what I wanna do for fun besides my career. 
                In conclusion, I can define my self as a person who wanna do everything he does in the perfect way possible, this way I can live with myself 
                knowing that I did something good and I get to be proud of my self.
